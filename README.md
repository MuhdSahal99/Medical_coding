Medical Coding Project
Overview
This project leverages advanced machine learning techniques to streamline medical coding, a critical process in healthcare documentation. The model is trained to identify and classify medical terms, procedures, and diagnoses, enabling accurate and efficient coding.

Features
Automated Medical Term Identification: Extracts relevant medical terms and codes from raw input data.
ICD Coding Support: Supports International Classification of Diseases (ICD) coding systems.
Customizable Training Data: Allows fine-tuning with custom datasets for domain-specific coding.
Batch Processing: Processes large datasets efficiently for scalability.
Cloud-Enabled & On-Premise Ready: Runs locally or can be deployed to cloud environments.
Tech Stack
Programming Language: Python
Libraries/Frameworks:
transformers for natural language processing
pandas for data manipulation
scikit-learn for model evaluation and utilities
Tools: Jupyter Notebooks, Git for version control
